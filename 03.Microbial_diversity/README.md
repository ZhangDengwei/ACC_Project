The script explored the microbial data, attempting to find associations between the intratumoral microbiome, microbial diversity, and overall survival. As [a previous study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2794337) reported the association between alpha diversity of the intratumoral microbiome and overall survival, we attempted to divide 77 ACC patients into two groups according to alpha diversity or overall survival and then investigate the difference in another factor.
